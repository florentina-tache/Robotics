## Poculum

The name of the game I want to create is 'Poculum'. It is borrowed from Latin and it means drinking vessel. 

You are a witch who brews potions to help people with their problems. The brewing of to potion is done by choosing different ingredients, each one being an LED connected to a button. Each of the LEDs will be coloured distinctly. To brew the potion the player will have to choose three ingredients and stir it. The stirring will be done by moving the joystick in the direction showed by an arrow on the matrix.

The game will have 5 levels. In each one of them a person will come to the witch and tell their problem. The witch has three chances to get the potion right. The faster the potion is made right, the higher the score will be. For every stirring movement done correctly extra score is added. Each level will be harder than the previous, so you can get higher score at a higher level. After finishing each level, an object will be shown on the matrix, being the outcome of the potion.
