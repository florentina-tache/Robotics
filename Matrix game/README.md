# Poculum

## Introduction
The name of the game is an English word borrowed from Latin, meaning drinking vessel. The story-driven game has as main character a
witch who brews potions using different ingredients: love(red), mystery(blue), nature(green), joy(yellow) and hope(white). People come to her with their problems and she knows there is always a potion that can help someone, she just needs to figure out how to make it. After making it, she poures it into the poculum and gives it to the one who requested it.

## How to play
After you have started the game, the intro will play. You can turn it off in the settings. If the game is over and you want to play again, the intro will be swiched off automatically but you can turn it on. To scroll through the dialogue press the joystick. After each level's dialogue has been scrolled through, you will have to choose three ingredients for your potion by pressing the button next to the LED that has the colour of the element you want. The LED will be turned off, meaning that you have selected it. If you have forgotten the meaning of the ingredients you can press the red button for a reminder anytime you have to choose them.
You have to keep pressing it until the LED displays 'Choosing ingredients..." again, otherwise you will not be able to select them. The dialogue clues about the elements needed for the right mix. Beware, some of them are not straight-forward. You have three chances to find the right potion. A message will be shown on the display to let you know how many tries you have left. The sooner you find the right many, more extra score will be added. 

After you have entered the right potion mix, you will have 3 seconds to get ready to stir it. You will have to move the joystick in the direction of the arrows displayed on the matrix. For each each stir done right you will get one extra point. After 5 arrows have been displayed, you will see the outcome of the potion on the matrix. 

Each of the five levels will be slightly more difficult than the previous and you will get a specific score for finishing each level. At the end, you will be notified if you made it to highscore.
