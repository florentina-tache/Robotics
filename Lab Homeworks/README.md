I have added the 'analogRGBControl' file, which contains the homework received in the 2nd laboratory. The idea of the code is that it receives an analog input by the potentiometer which is used to control one of the leds.

The file 'KnockDetectorBuzzer' contains the code needed for the 3rd homework. It detects knocks using an active buzzer and 5 seconds after one has ben detected a passive buzzer starts playing a tone. The pushbutton stops the tone.
