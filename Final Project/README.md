# The Robotic Bug
## Introduction
Bug are small, sometimes friendly, sometimes dangerous creatures. Some people are afraid of them, some like to collect them. Fear not, this bug is very friendly and you can add it to your collection, it will not mind.
This bug can crawl in three directions, forward, left or right and it also makes sounds. The bug gets excited when there is light. The more light it is, the faster it will crawl and more pitchy sounds it will make.

## Assembly
List of hardware used: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Htry010sDG5Vxl1XxuDkIDsEU6a6pIBbHVVmY9l-o_E/edit#gid=1674280052

Two Servo motors are used to control the frond and back legs. I have used wooden skewers for the legs. The side legs are used for balance, so that the bug will not fall when it moves left and right.

The photodiode is used to measure the quantity of light projected upon it. The quantity is inversely proportional with the crawling speed of the bug and directly proportional with the pitch of its sound.
I have used the charger to power the bug but the battery can also be used.
